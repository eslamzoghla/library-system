## The purpose of the project is to create a library system in the college.
This system helps the librarian in managing the library and converting it to the digital system.  It provides some features, for example, adding books to the database and modifying them, or searching for a book request from the student, controlling and managing students and adding them to the database. We used visual studio code and SQLite app to make this system. The application is divided into 5 screens. The first screen is the main screen and the remaining four are sub screens. The main screen has four buttons, when you press any button, the main screen disappears and any of the sub screens appears according to the button, and can back to the main screen.
